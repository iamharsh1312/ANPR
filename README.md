# ANPR
### ANPR is one of the most accurate applications of computer vision systems. Systems for automated number plate recognition use optical character recognition (OCR) to read vehicle registration plates. Cameras capture high-speed images of number plates, and software for image processing is used to detect characters, verify the sequence of those characters, and convert the number plate image to text.

### Firstly, the ANPR camera captures images that contain a license plate (video stream or photo).
### Then, the plate is detected using machine learning and computer vision processes (Object Detection)
### Finally, OCR software is applied to the detected plate area to return the license plate number in text format. The converted number is usually stored in a database for integration with other IT systems.

## Use Case
### Law enforcement. Police forces use ANPR for law enforcement purposes, including to check if a vehicle is registered or to identify vehicles related to traffic violations. The ability to detect and recognize number plates in real-time allows authorities to identify vehicles and track their location.

### Car parking management. Car parking management requires an integrated solution to detect individual vehicles. Hence, automated number plate recognition is the key to efficient car parking management. ANPR allows parking garages to have automated parking management because every car is accounted for by its license plate number.

### Traffic management. Traffic management is the umbrella term for a plethora of advantages that ANPR offers. ANPR can be used throughout cities to detect overspeeding vehicles, vehicles that drive rashly, or any accidental occurrence
